# Disclaimer -- Safety and Liability Notice

## ⚠️ THIS SOFTWARE CAN MISCONFIGURE YOUR AIRCRAFT

ArduGUI is experimental, pre-alpha software that directly modifies flight controller parameters. Incorrect parameters can cause an aircraft to behave unpredictably, lose control, crash, cause property damage, or injure people.

## No Warranty

This software is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the software is with you.

## No Liability

In no event shall the authors, contributors, or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Damage to aircraft, vehicles, or equipment
- Personal injury or death
- Property damage
- Financial loss
- Loss of data

## Not Field-Tested

ArduGUI has **not been validated through flight testing**. The parameter values it writes, the configurations it suggests, and the interfaces it presents may contain errors. Bugs are expected at this stage of development.

## Mandatory Verification

**You must independently verify every parameter change** made by ArduGUI using a trusted, established ground control station such as:

- [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/) (recommended)
- [QGroundControl](https://qgroundcontrol.com/)

Do not fly an aircraft configured solely with ArduGUI without cross-checking against one of these tools.
